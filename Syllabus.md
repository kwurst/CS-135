* Your professional career

## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a three-credit course. You should expect to spend, on average, 9 hours per week on this class.***

You should expect to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week outside of class during the semester reading the textbook, accessing class preparation materials, studying, doing assignments, working on projects, and practicing in order to master the concepts and use of the language and modules covered in the course. (See Definition of the Credit Hour)

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

>---New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education, [Policy on Credits and Degrees](http://cihe.neasc.org/downloads/POLICIES/Pp111_PolicyOnCreditsAndDegrees.pdf)

## Prerequisites
This course has a prerequisite of a math placement score 3 or above. This prerequisite can also be met by having taken a college-level math course for credit. A partial list of those math concepts that I expect you to understand is: 

* Arithmetic, fractions, decimals, percentages, rates, ratios, proportions, word problems, graphs and tables, signed numbers, variables, expressions, functions.

***If you are missing any of this background, you should not take this course.***

## Attendance
You are expected to attend every class. Past experience has shown that students who do not attend class do not do as well on exams and projects.

## Course Objectives
> From having taken one course in programing, a student – any student ([CS] major or not) – should walk away from [that] course and somewhere later in his or her career address a problem by thinking, “Hey, I’ll just write a program to solve that.” 
> 
> – Punch and Enbody, The Practice of Computing using Python, 2011, p. xxi.

## Course Philosophy
During this semester we will be learning to design, write and test programs that can be used to manipulate data in a number of ways. The emphasis will be on solving real-life data analysis problems in a variety of disciplines. We will be using the Python programming language which has the advantage of being (relatively) easy to learn and has a large collection of modules contributed by other users. We will spend most of our class time working in groups or on the computer trying out new concepts and techniques. This will give us all a chance to learn new material with the support and help of the instructor and your classmates. Larger projects completed outside of class will lead toward more complete mastery of the material. Finally, we will work on individual or group final projects, developing a program to solve some problem in our own disciplines and learning from each other’s experience on these projects.

You are encouraged to help each other out, in and out of the classroom, as long as you do your own work. (See Academic Conduct below.)

## Instructional MethodsThis class will not be a traditional “lecture” class, and will incorporate some teaching methods that may be unfamiliar to you.### POGILRather than lecturing about the course content, you and your classmates will "discover" the content for yourselves through small-group work.

The group work will be a very structured style called Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Through investigation of models of the concepts and answering questions that guide the team toward understanding of the models, your team will both learn the content and team process skills. In your POGIL groups each group member will have a specific role to play during the activity, and roles will be rotated so that everyone will get to experience a variety of process skills.

For more information on POGIL, see [https://pogil.org/about-pogil/what-is-pogil](https://pogil.org/about-pogil/what-is-pogil).### Pair ProgrammingDuring labs, you will work in a pair with one of your classmates. One of you will type while the other makes suggestions, watches for errors, reads the assignment, and thinks ahead. You will switch roles frequently during the lab session. You will be randomly assigned a new partner each lab. This will allow you to get to know the other members of the class, work with partners of different abilities and programming styles, and develop relationships that may extend beyond to classroom.

## Grading Policies
I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: *X* and *Y*. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome *X*, and a grade of 40 for outcome *Y*, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome *Y*.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification. 
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in a ***Meets Specification*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading
* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis. 
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be marked *Meets Specification*.** 
* Failing to meet ***any part*** of the specification will result in the work being marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**. 
* There will be no partial credit given. 
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with **Does Not Yet Meet Specification** grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an *Meets Specification* manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn Base Grade<br>A | Earn Base Grade<br>B | Earn BaseGrade<br>C | Earn Base Grade<br>D 
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Attendance and Participation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; In-class Activity Classes (out of 18) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Final Project Work Classes (out of 7) | <br>18<br>6 | <br>17<br>5 | <br>16<br>4 | <br>15<br>3
Readings Quizzes Average | &ge; 90% | &ge; 80% | &ge; 70%  | &ge; 60%
zyBooks Practice<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Participation Activities<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Challenge Activities | <br>100% <br> &ge; 90% | <br> &ge; 90% <br> &ge; 80% | <br> &ge; 80% <br> &ge; 70% | <br> &ge; 70% <br> &ge; 60%
Laboratory Assignments (*n* &approx; 8) | *n* | *n* | *n* | *n-1*

Discussion Logs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Lab Assignments (*n* &approx; 8)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Programming Assignments (*n* &approx; 6)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Final Project (out of 4) | <br>4<br>5<br>4 | <br>3<br>4<br>3 | <br>2<br>3<br>2 | <br>1<br>2<br>1
Final Project<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Proposal Meets Specification<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Presentation Meets Specification<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Submitted presentation and code | <br>&check;<br>&check;<br>&check; | <br>&check;<br>&check;<br>&check; | <br>&check;<br>&check;<br>&check; | <br>&check;<br>&check;<br>&check;
Exam Grade Average (2 exams) | > 50% | > 50% | > 50% | &le; 50%

* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to submit 4  Programming Assignment Disussion Logs that meet specification, you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is lower than 60%.
* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is 85% or higher.
* Each unused token remaining at the end of the semester can be used to increase the exam average by 2 percentage points.

*Notes:*
 
* WSU has no A+ grade.
* I reserve the right to revise *downward* the required number of assignments needed for each base grade due to changes in number of assignments assigned or unexpected difficulties with assignments.

## Attendance and Participation

### For In-Class Activity Classes
Because a significant portion of your learning will take place during the in-class activities and as part of your team, class attendance and participation are exteremely important.

For your attendance and participation to be considered to *Meet Specification*, you must:

* Arrive on time and stay for the entire class session.
* Participate fully in the in-class activity:
    * Fulfill all responsibilities of your team role.
    * Contribute to the team's learning and answers to questions.
    * Work as part of the team on the activity (not on your own.)
    * Work on the in-class activity (not some other work.)

**You will be using your computer within your group activities and labs. You should only be using your computer for the classwork. You should not be checking sites that are unrelated to the course, or messaging friends. If I see that you are doing other things on your computer and not participating in your group, I will warn you. If I have to warn you a second time during that class, you will lose your participation points for that class.**

### For Final Project Work Classes
The Final Project Work Classes are important to provide you and your partner with a consistent, guaranteed time when you can meet to discuss the design of your application, troubleshoot development difficulties, and get advice and help from your instructor. Software development is not a solitary activity, and teams make more progess at face-to-face meetings than they do at virtual meetings.

For your attendance and participation to be considered to *Meet Specification*, you must:

* Arrive on time and stay for the entire class session.
* Work on your project (not some other work.)
* Work with your partner to coordinate work that will happen individually between class sessions.

## Quizzes on ReadingsYou will take quizzes on the readings so that I may assess where students are having conceptual difficulties with the material. In addition to giving an answer to the quiz questions, you will required to explain your reasoning for the answers you chose. 

***All quizzes can be attempted an unlimited number of times before the due date/time.***

## zyBooks PracticeThe zyBooks textbook contains both Participation activities, where credit is given simply for trying the activity, and Challenge activities which require a correct answer. 

***All activities can be attempted an unlimited number of times before the due date/time.***
## Laboratory AssignmentsThe laboratory assignments provide you with the chance to explore the Python language and development tools in an incremental, guided way. This will help you develop confidence and mastery before you are asked to complete programming projects on your own.

## Programming Projects
The programming projects will give you a chance to apply the material to larger tasks. These projects will require you to interpret the problem description, do some planning and design, possibly research and evaluate third-party modules, implement your program, and test and debug it. 

**Submitted** means that the project has been submitted on time, has all or most of the appropriate code and functions to complete the solution, runs (but maybe not correctly in all cases), but may need some cleaning up to really meet the specifiations. Generally, the student has put in sufficient effort, but the solution is just a little bit "off the mark". 

## Discussion Logs



## Final Project and Presentation
For the last 5 weeks of the semester we will work on individual or group programming projects. You will work on some data from your particular major or area of interest. With the instructor’s guidance you will determine what analysis you wish to perform on your data, and develop a program to perform that analysis. 

During the scheduled final exam period, you will present your final project to the class. Our Final Exam period is scheduled for Tuesday, 17 December - 12:30-3:30pm

## Exams
There will be two exams given during the semester. Both exams will be given during a regular class period.

* Exam 1 is tentatively scheduled to be given during class on 8 October 2019.
* Exam 2 is tentatively scheduled to be given during class on 12 November 2019.

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

It is strongly recommended that you keep copies of your projects. Students are responsible for reproducing any lost work including unreadable files.

Graded assignments (with comments and solutions) will be returned to you electronically. *Please make sure that you review the comments and solutions provided, so that you can improve your future assignments.* Ask me questions about the comments if you do not understand them.


## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work

If you receive a ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** on any assignment you may revise and resubmit the assignment ***one time only*** without the use of a token. If you need to submit an assignment a third time, you will have to spend a token.

* You must have submitted the original assignment on time, (or one day late with the use of a token.)
* You must submit your revision within one week from the date when the "Not Acceptable" grade was posted in Blackboard and comments were posted in GitLab. (You may use a token to submit the revision one day late.)
* You may ask me for clarification of the assignment, or of the comments I made on your submission.
* You may ask me to look at your revised solution to see if it addresses my comments.
* If you address all the comments in an acceptable fashion, your grade will be converted to ***Meets Specification***.
* You must let me know by a comment in GitLab when you resubmit the assignment, so that I know to regrade it.

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens over the course of the semester. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Each token can be used to:

* replace a single missed class session (up to a maximum of 2 missed class sessions)
* turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* revise and resubmit an assignment that was judged "Does Not Yet Meet Specification" beyond the second attempt. Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date. 

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (kwurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office (ST 110A). My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/]()) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-135]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.** 

<img src="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd042215s.gif"><br><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795</a>

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University's Student Code of Conduct (<a href="http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/</a>).

## Student Responsibilities 
* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* When working with a partner, participate actively. Don't let your partner do all the work - you won't learn anything that way.
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the academic success center (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Accessibility Statement
Worcester State University values the diversity of all of our students, faculty and staff.  We recognize the importance of each student’s contribution to our campus community.  WSU is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in programs and services at WSU.  If you have a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Services at SAS@worcester.edu or 508-929-8733.  Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision. 

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the Academic Success Center (ASC).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible or contact the Tutoring Coordinator at 508-929-8139

## The Math Center
The Math Center provides free assistance to students in Mathematics.  It is located on the first floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S143.

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.  To schedule an appointment, please call 508-929-8112 or email the Center at writingcenter@worcester.edu.  To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center's hours and the Center's Online Writing Lab, visit their website at <a href="http://www2.worcester.edu/WritingCenter/" target="_blank">http://www2.worcester.edu/WritingCenter/</a>.

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. All work must be done independently unless assigned as a group project. You may discuss assignments and materials with other students, but you should never share answers or files. **Everything that you turn in must be your own original work, unless specified otherwise in the assignment.**

Students may help each other understand the programming language and the development environment but students may not discuss actual solutions, design or implementation, to their programming assignments before they are submitted or share code or help each other debug their programming assignments. The assignments are the primary means used to teach the techniques and principles of computer programming; only by completing the programs individually will students receive the full benefit of the assignments. If you are looking at each other’s code before you submit your own, you are in violation of this policy. 

Students may not use solutions to assignments from any textbooks other than the text assigned for the course, or from any person other than the instructor, or from any Internet site, or from any other source not specifically allowed by the instructor. If a student copies code from an unauthorized source and submits it as a solution to an assignment, the student will receive a 0 for that assignment.

**Any inappropriate sharing of work or use of another's work without attribution will result in a grade of zero on that assignment for all parties involved. If you do so a second time, you will receive an “E” for the course.**

Academic integrity is an essential component of a Worcester State education. Education is both the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills that lead to further intellectual development. Faculty are expected to follow strict principles of intellectual honesty in their own scholarship; students are held to the same standard. Only by doing their own work can students gain the knowledge, skills, confidence and self-worth that come from earned success; only by learning how to gather information, to integrate it and to communicate it effectively, to identify an idea and follow it to its logical conclusion can they develop the habits of mind characteristic of educated citizens. Taking shortcuts to higher or easier grades results in a Worcester State experience that is intellectually bankrupt.

Academic integrity is important to the integrity of the Worcester State community as a whole. If Worcester State awards degrees to students who have not truly earned them, a reputation for dishonesty and incompetence will follow all of our graduates. Violators cheat their classmates out of deserved rewards and recognition. Academic dishonesty debases the institution and demeans the degree from that institution.  

It is in the interest of students, faculty, and administrators to recognize the importance of academic integrity and to ensure that academic standards at Worcester State remain strong. Only by maintaining high standards of academic honesty can we protect the value of the educational process and the credibility of the institution and its graduates in the larger community.

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College's Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears in: <a href="http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/</a>**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**

## Student Work Retention Policy
It is my policy to securely dispose of student work one calendar year after grades have been submitted for a course.
