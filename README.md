## LASC Quantitative Reasoning Objectives
This course will:

1.	Acquaint students with formal systems, procedures and sequences of operations.
2.	Strengthen students' understanding of variables and functions.
3.	Apply mathematical techniques to the analysis and solution of real-life problems.
4.	Emphasize the importance of accuracy, including precise language and careful definitions of mathematical concepts.
5.	Understand both the underlying principles and practical applications of one or more fields of mathematics.
6.	Strengthen understanding of the relationship between algebraic and graphical representations.
